    <h2>About my Home Page</h2>
    <p>
        For the home page, I decided to use a photo of my wife 
        from a romantic dinner. I particularly like this photo of her. The video 
        below is of a pjoject I was working on for a previous class. I was plying
        with the float parameters to get an idea of how to anchor the images to the
        page when the page display. 
    </p>
    <video onclick="playPause()" id="myVid" autoplay>
        <source  src="images/work.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
    <br>
        <script>
            var myvideo = document.getElementById("myVid");
            function playPause(){
                if(myvideo.paused)
                    myvideo.play();
                else
                    myvideo.pause();
            }
        </script>

    <h2>About the Additional Pages</h2>
    <p>        
        The Instuctors html is a simple page with the OIT Hootie inset as the background. The Student page simply lists student IDs and emails in a tabular format. 
        It uses the same backround image as the Instructors page. 
    </p>
    <h2> Additional Elements </h2>
    <p>
        The image and video links in the page are current centered, I tried the stagger them 
        (float:right for the image and float:left for the video);  however,
        the image alignments also seemed to adversaly affect the sizes of the 
        video and it began overlapping the other text. I removed the separate button suggested
         by the w3schools.com tutorial and went with a clickable video instead.
